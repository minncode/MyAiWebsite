### 🧠 Key Learnings and Challenges
## 1. Resolving CORS Issues
Challenge: CORS policy violations due to domain mismatches between Vercel and Render.
Solution:
Implemented dynamic CORS handling in the backend:

app.use(cors({
  origin: (origin, callback) => {
    const allowedOrigins = [
      'https://cvwithaichat-app.vercel.app',
      'https://cvwithaichat-2wi0hk4do-kim-minsungs-projects.vercel.app',
      'http://localhost:3000',
    ];
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, origin);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
}));
Adapted to Vercel’s dynamic domain changes by allowing multiple origins.

## 2. Handling Hugging Face API 403 Errors
Challenge: Encountered 403 errors due to lack of access to the google/gemma-2-9b-it model.
Solution:
Requested access to the model on Hugging Face and resolved the issue.
Secured the API key using environment variables for safety.

## 3. Deployment Configuration
Challenge: Port conflicts in Render and environment variable loading issues.
Solution:
Used process.env.PORT for dynamic port binding:
const port = process.env.PORT;
Configured environment variables in both Render and Vercel dashboards.

## 4. Improving AI Response Quality
Challenge: AI responses lacked structure and readability.
Solution:
Applied prompt engineering to enforce structured responses:
const prompt = `
  Respond to users' questions in a clean, structured format.
  - Your answers should be concise and clear.
  - If you use lists, separate each item with a line break and number it.
  - Avoid unnecessary repetition and provide specific advice that reflects the user's context.
  ${userInput}
`;
Enhanced readability by post-processing responses in the frontend using the formatResponse function.

### 🔮 Future Improvements
Model Enhancement: Transition to a more advanced language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5) for better performance.
User Experience: Add chat history storage and dark mode support.
Performance Optimization: Implement response caching on the backend.
Multilingual Support: Add Vietnamese and Japanese language support for broader accessibility.
