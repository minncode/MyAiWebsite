# CVwithAI Chat App

![CVwithAI Chat App](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=CVwithAI+Chat+App) <!-- Add a screenshot for better visuals -->

## Project Overview

**CVwithAI Chat App** is a web application that enables real-time conversations with AI, developed as a portfolio project for my internship application at Naver Japan’s Vietnam office. The application consists of a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js, utilizing Hugging Face’s `google/gemma-2-9b-it` model for natural language processing. It is deployed using Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in frontend-backend communication, API integration, CORS issue resolution, cloud deployment, and improving AI response quality.

---

## Key Features

- **AI Conversations**: The `google/gemma-2-9b-it` model generates natural responses to user messages.
- **Real-Time Chat Interface**: A responsive UI built with React for seamless user interaction.
- **Hugging Face API Integration**: Leverages the Hugging Face Inference API for AI response generation.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - React (`react`, `react-router-dom`)
  - CSS Modules (`*.module.css`)
  - Vercel (deployment)
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js (`express`, `axios`, `cors`, `express-rate-limit`)
  - Render (deployment)
- **API**:
  - Hugging Face Inference API (`google/gemma-2-9b-it`)
- **Others**:
  - Git/GitHub (version control)
  - Environment Variables (configuration management)

Key Learnings and Challenges
1. Resolving CORS Issues
Challenge: CORS policy violations due to domain mismatches between Vercel and Render.
Solution:
Implemented dynamic CORS handling in the backend:
javascript

접기

복사
app.use(cors({
  origin: (origin, callback) => {
    const allowedOrigins = [
      'https://cvwithaichat-app.vercel.app',
      'https://cvwithaichat-2wi0hk4do-kim-minsungs-projects.vercel.app',
      'http://localhost:3000',
    ];
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, origin);
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
    }
  },
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
}));
Adapted to Vercel’s dynamic domain changes by allowing multiple origins.
2. Handling Hugging Face API 403 Errors
Challenge: Encountered 403 errors due to lack of access to the google/gemma-2-9b-it model.
Solution:
Requested access to the model on Hugging Face and resolved the issue.
Secured the API key using environment variables for safety.
3. Deployment Configuration
Challenge: Port conflicts in Render and environment variable loading issues.
Solution:
Used process.env.PORT for dynamic port binding:
javascript

복사
const port = process.env.PORT;
Configured environment variables in both Render and Vercel dashboards.
4. Improving AI Response Quality
Challenge: AI responses lacked structure and readability.
Solution:
Applied prompt engineering to enforce structured responses:
javascript

접기

자동 줄바꿈

복사
const prompt = `
  Respond to users' questions in a clean, structured format.
  - Your answers should be concise and clear.
  - If you use lists, separate each item with a line break and number it.
  - Avoid unnecessary repetition and provide specific advice that reflects the user's context.
  ${userInput}
`;
Enhanced readability by post-processing responses in the frontend using the formatResponse function.
Future Improvements
Model Enhancement: Transition to a more advanced language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5) for better performance.
User Experience: Add chat history storage and dark mode support.
Performance Optimization: Implement response caching on the backend.
Multilingual Support: Add Vietnamese and Japanese language support for broader accessibility.
Why Naver Japan?
I developed this project as part of my application for an internship at Naver Japan’s Vietnam office. Naver Japan is renowned for its innovative AI technologies and user-centric services, such as LINE and advanced search capabilities. Through this project, I honed my skills in frontend and backend development, API integration, and cloud deployment, while also improving my problem-solving abilities by addressing challenges like CORS issues and AI response quality. I am particularly interested in contributing to Naver Japan’s Vietnam office by leveraging my experience to develop multilingual features, especially for Vietnamese and Japanese users, aligning with Naver’s global outreach goals.

### Additional Tips
- **Add Screenshots**:
  - Include a screenshot of the chat interface in the `cvwithaichat-app/screenshots/` folder and reference it in the `README.md`:
    ```markdown
    ![Chat Interface](screenshots/chat-interface.png)
Highlight Technical Depth:
The "Key Learnings and Challenges" section includes code snippets to demonstrate your problem-solving skills.
Ensure Demo Works:
Verify that the demo links are functional, as Naver Japan reviewers may test them (beware of Render’s free tier sleep mode).
Professional Tone:
Used a formal yet approachable tone suitable for an internship application.
